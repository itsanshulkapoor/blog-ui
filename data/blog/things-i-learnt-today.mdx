As a frontend engineer, my usual playground involves React components and battling browser quirks. But today, I took a delightful detour into the world of Node.js and command-line interfaces (CLIs) – purely for the joy of coding!

I followed a fantastic LogRocket [guide](https://blog.logrocket.com/building-typescript-cli-node-js-commander/) to build a simple TypeScript CLI. The goal? An app that could read directories, and create new files or folders. And wow, what a learning curve!

One immediate eye-opener was just how asynchronous everything is in Node.js, especially with file operations. Functions like those in the built-in fs module are almost always async. Coming from frontend, where async/await often means API calls, seeing it for basic file I/O felt like learning a whole new grammatical rule!

Unlocking New Powers with npm Packages

Understanding Node's core packages like fs felt like unlocking a secret level. It's a foundational step into backend development, giving me direct programmatic control over the file system – something completely new compared to browser environments.

## The real fun began with awesome npm packages:

**commander.js**: This is a total game-changer for CLIs. It elegantly handles parsing arguments, defining commands, and even auto-generating help messages. It cut down so much boilerplate, letting me focus on the app's logic.

**figlet**: Okay, this one was just super cool! It lets you display awesome ASCII art banners in your terminal. A small touch, but it instantly made my CLI feel polished and fun.

I coded locally, embraced TypeScript, and eventually pushed my little creation to [GitHub](https://github.com/itsanshulkapoor/simple-node-module/tree/main).

This first dive into Node.js CLIs was incredibly rewarding. It's a great reminder that the programming world is huge, and there's always something fresh and exciting to learn, even within the JavaScript ecosystem.
