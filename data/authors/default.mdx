Hey there! Welcome to Code With Kaps, the place where we geek out about all things front-end engineering and dive deep into the ever-evolving world of tech.

I'm Anshul, and by day, I'm a Tech Lead at a software company, immersed in crafting seamless user experiences and tackling complex coding challenges. But beyond the daily grind, I'm fueled by an insatiably curious mind that loves to explore, experiment, and understand the "why" behind the "what" in technology.

Here, you'll find a blend of professional insights and personal explorations. We'll break down intricate front-end concepts, share practical tips for software development, review the latest tools and trends, and muse on the future of techâ€”all with a pragmatic yet playful approach.

So, whether you're a fellow engineer, an aspiring developer, or just someone with a keen interest in how the digital world is built, I invite you to join me on this journey of continuous learning and discovery. Let's build something amazing together!
